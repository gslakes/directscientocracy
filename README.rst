Direct scientocracy - debate forum
===================================

This is a project for implementing ideas from direct scientocracy.
In particular, this is a project for developing debate forum software.


Direct scientocracy is the idea that decisions (policy) made at any scale
are best made collaboratively, directly involving the people impacted
by the decision, guided by evidence and logic in a manner similar to that
of the scientific method, and constrained by a charter of ethics.


This particular project is based on the open source Askbot Q&A system
http://askbot.org

Askbot documentation is in the directory askbot/doc

Askbot itself is based on code of CNPROG, originally created by Mike Chen 
and Sailing Cai and some code written for OSQA.
